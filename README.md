This was done through using the jQuery plugins and using a set of arrays to fill in what should be typed, how fast, what chracter the cusor should be and how fast the thign gets deleted 

#### Was this my first time?
Yes thsi was the very first tiem that I hae made this perosnal porfoilio and it will stand since it the future I know the layout of my websites will chnage but it will stand from where I progressed


## Lessons Learned

The biggest thing that I learned from this was the importance of going from mobile to desktop the main problem I did was that I did not follow that rle and so tryign to make everyhtign fit when it was going to mobile meant that from my wireframes due to me messign up that process I had to change how I went about that 


## Appendix

Yes I know it is bad I am trying but the biggest mistake was the messup in the planning process
